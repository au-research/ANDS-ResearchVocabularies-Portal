### ANDS Research Vocabularies Repository Structure

The Research Vocabularies software is structured into a number of
separate software repositories, which need to be deployed together:

- (this repository) `au-research/ANDS-ResearchVocabularies-Portal` - the front-end portal codebase.
- `au-research/ANDS-ResearchVocabularies-Registry` - the back-end registry and toolkit.
- `au-research/ANDS-ResearchVocabularies-LDA` - ANDS-local customizations applied to the SISSVoc implementation of the Linked Data API.

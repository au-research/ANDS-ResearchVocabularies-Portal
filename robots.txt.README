Please copy robots.txt.sample as robots.txt, and modify as necessary
to suit your setup.

For example, you may prefer to block everything. If so, put this in
robots.txt instead:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /

For ARDC-internal use: the various environments have their own
robots.txt files in the vocabs-portal-config repository.
